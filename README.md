# Visual Analytics Final Project
The project is about analyzing the causes of accidents in accident data file, occurring in different states in USA. We have downloaded data from Kaggle website. The data is related to US traffic fatalities for the year 2015. It is created and maintained by national center of statistics and analysis (NCSA). This dataset has details of motor vehicle crash resulting in the death of occupant/non- occupant of vehicle within 30 days of crash. End users for this project could be police officers, tarffic safety personnels and the car companies. Using this data we have created an interactive dashboard, where the end users can see the number of fatalities occuring in different states in the United States and how the accidents are related to weather and light conditions. Based on the visuals they can take decisions such as issue such as installing some more cameras at traffic signals, deploying more officers, spreading more awareness to people for safe driving tips such as no texting while driving or no to drink and drive cases. The Dashboard is designed using accident.csv file and is based on D3 visualization and interaction.
